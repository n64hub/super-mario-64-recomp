# CLAUDE.md

A static recompilation of the N64 *Super Mario 64* (USA 1.0) with N64Recomp, N64ModernRuntime, RecompFrontend and
RT64, from the n64decomp/sm64 symbols. Almost all of it is written by AI agents, so this file is what the next one
needs: the rules, where things are, and the facts about the game the code can't say on its own.

## What lives where

This repo is the game: its recompilation, the patches over it, the desktop build and its web page.

- `syms/`: the symbols N64Recomp reads, generated (never edited by hand) by `tools/build_decomp.sh` then
  `tools/gen_syms.sh` (`tools/gen_syms.py` says how).
- `us.toml`: N64Recomp's configuration; `tools/recompile.sh` writes `RecompiledFuncs/` with it.
- `patches/` and `patches.toml`: MIPS C against `lib/sm64`'s headers, recompiled into PatchesLib. Its `ui_funcs.h`,
  `patch_helpers.h` and `recompui_event_structs.h` are RecompFrontend's, which includes the first from the game's
  `patches/`.
- `src/`: RecompFrontend's main (`src/main/main.cpp`, with the GameEntry), the natives the patches call
  (`src/game/recomp_api.cpp`) and the settings.
- `lib/`: `sm64` (the decomp, for the symbols and the patches' headers), upstream `rt64`, `N64ModernRuntime` and
  `RecompFrontend` at the commits N64Recomp-browser's web forks are built on, and `N64Recomp-browser` at a release tag.
  The web support every recomp's page shares is developed and documented there; `tools/build_n64recomp.sh` and
  `CMakeLists.txt` apply its `patches/` to the other three, and `CMakeLists.txt` then this game's own changes to them
  (`runtime-patches/`, its README lists them). `xbrz` is xBRZ, vendored, for Hi-res Font.
- `docs/web.md`: the web page: building it (`tools/build_web.sh`), the survey a script drives it by
  (`patches/shader_survey.c`, `tools/shader_survey.js`), the play plans (`tools/play_plan*.json`), the prebuilt shader
  list (`src/rt64_shaders.txt`) and what the page measured. The page's part of N64Recomp-browser (its Games row, its
  part of `docs/game-forks.md`, `tools/publish_pages.sh`'s `sm64`) is there, and every play of the page is a line in
  N64Recomp-browser's `plays.jsonl` (`play_page.mjs --record plays.jsonl --game sm64`), never here.
- Comments beside the code, for how and why: each file's header. Read the header of the file you change and update
  it in the same commit.

## Rules

- No ROMs, ROM-derived assets or extracted game data in git, CI or PRs (`tools/ci/check_repo.py` checks). Nothing
  from the decomp's `assets/` or its build is committed but `syms/`. The launcher's art is text only (`icons/`): no
  logo, character or picture from the game.
- The decomp is built only where the ROM is, never in CI.
- The page is built where the ROM is and published to this repo's Pages (`gh-pages`) by N64Recomp-browser's
  `tools/publish_pages.sh` (its `docs/publishing.md`), its `.data` holding nothing from the ROM. The desktop releases are built where the ROM is too, by
  `tools/release.sh` (its header says how), and published to GitHub Releases with their notes in `releases/`.
- The scope is the game as it plays, plus what a web page needs (RT64 interpolation to the display's rate, resolution
  Auto), plus the README's Modern enhancements: each an option with an Original value that plays as the console does,
  none changing how the game plays. No camera changes, cheats or 60 fps logic. USA 1.0 only, with one thing
  from the Japanese Shindou edition: its rumble, as an enhancement.
- Write for a stranger, in the present tense: nothing about a contributor's machine, servers, paths or accounts, and
  nothing about where anyone keeps ROMs.
- GPL-3.0, as the recompilations it follows.

## How it fits together

- **The code.** Three code segments, all stored raw in the ROM (MIO0 is only used for data), each a static section
  at a fixed address:
  - `main`: ROM 0x1000, VRAM 0x80246000, 0xF4580 bytes. The boot code copies it; the runtime maps it at start
    (it registers what lies in ROM 0x1000 plus 1 MB).
  - `engine`: ROM 0xF5580, VRAM 0x80378800, 0x13490 bytes, DMA'd in once by `load_engine_code_segment`.
  - `goddard` (the title screen's Mario head, the file and star select menus): ROM 0x21F4C0, VRAM 0x8016F000,
    0x4A9E0 bytes, loaded again and again by the level scripts' FIXED_LOAD.
  Every DMA the game makes goes through `dma_read` (src/game/memory.c), so `patches/overlays.c` patches it to tell the
  runtime which code it just brought in.
- **No TLB.** The runtime has none. The game's one real mapping is goddard's dynlists (the Mario head's), a
  segment linked at 0x04000000 that `load_dynlist` DMAs into a buffer and maps there: `patches/dynlist.c`
  relocates the buffer instead, which is exact for US 1.0 (its header says how that was checked). The boot's
  other osMapTLB is a no-op (`src/game/recomp_api.cpp`).
- **Busy waits.** ultramodern runs one game thread at a time and preempts none, so a loop that waits for another
  game thread has to yield (`recomp_yield`). `wait_for_audio_frames`, where the game waits for the sound thread
  while it resets the audio, is the one met so far (`patches/audio.c`).
- **Narrow arguments.** IDO narrows an s8, u8, s16 or u16 argument in the function that takes it, so the game's
  callers pass whatever the register holds; clang's code assumes the caller narrowed it. A patch replacing a game
  function whose caller passes a wider value takes that argument as an s32 and narrows it itself:
  `create_skybox_facing_camera` gets the background node's word, the background twice, and indexed the sky's lists
  with it otherwise (`patches/interpolation.c`).
- **Stubs.** `us.toml` stubs three functions whose code doesn't recompile or calls what the runtime lacks: debug and
  never-called code, each with its reason there.
- **The symbols.** The decomp's US build is IDO 5.3 at `-g`, so it is unoptimised. IDO writes no symbol for a static
  function, so the ELF is relinked keeping `.mdebug` and N64Recomp reads them from there (`use_mdebug`). Its `.mdebug`
  reader leaves those sizes 0 and the decomp's assembly gives its functions no size: `gen_syms.py` fills both in.
- **The entry point** is the decomp's `entry_point` at 0x80246000. `us.toml` ignores the labels inside libultra's
  exception handler, which use cop0 registers.
- **Microcodes.** Graphics: f3d_old, Fast3D 2.0D (`rsp/fast3d.s`), which RT64 knows by its hash as F3D_SM64 and
  draws as F3D, as it does Pilotwings 64's and Wave Race 64's. Audio: aspMain, libultra's standard audio microcode,
  recompiled by RSPRecomp from `aspMain.us.toml` (its header says how its layout and handler table were found).
  librecomp's vector unit uses SSE4.1, so `RecompiledFuncs` builds with `-march=nehalem` on x86-64.
- **Jump tables.** N64Recomp finds all of the game's itself (147, each a `switch` in `RecompiledFuncs/`, and
  `recomp.log` names no unresolved `jr`), so `us.toml` lists none by hand.
- **Saves.** EEPROM, 4 Kbit: the decomp's `save_file.h` has `EEPROM_SIZE` 0x200 and `save_file.c` asserts the save
  buffer is exactly that. `main.cpp` declares `SaveType::Eep4k`; the runtime keeps it in
  `saves/sm64.n64.us.1.0.bin`, in the game's own byte order, and writes it a moment after the game saves, so a test
  waits a few seconds before it stops the game.
- **Input.** RecompFrontend's default bindings, nothing of the game's own. Keyboard: WASD the stick, Space A, Left
  Shift B, Q Z, R R, E L, Enter Start, the arrows the C buttons. A gamepad: the left stick, the south button A, the
  west one B, the left trigger Z, the right trigger R, the left bumper L, Start, and the right stick for the C
  buttons (or north, east, the right stick's click and the right bumper for C left, right, up and down).
- **Testing without the speakers.** `main.cpp` asks SDL for WASAPI only when `SDL_AUDIODRIVER` isn't set, so a test
  records the game's sound with SDL's disk driver (`SDL_AUDIODRIVER=disk`, `SDL_DISKAUDIOFILE=<file>`: F32 stereo at
  48 kHz). On Windows that driver runs slow, about 0.92 of real time: it sleeps 5 ms per 5.33 ms buffer, and the
  sleeps overrun. The game makes its sound to the device's clock within 16 samples a frame, so a slow device shows
  up as skipped samples (`queue_samples` drops some above 100 ms queued). To keep real time, point
  `SDL_DISKAUDIOFILE` at a named pipe that the test reads at 48000 frames a second, with the delay off. Because
  SDL 2.30's `SDL_getenv` on Windows returns one shared buffer, `SDL_DISKAUDIODELAY` must hold the same text as the
  file name (its `atoi` is 0). Any other value replaces the file name, and SDL writes to a file named by it as fast
  as it can.
- **Driving it from a test.** A test that plays by posting `WM_KEYDOWN`/`WM_KEYUP` to the game's window (it reaches
  the game whether or not the window has focus) can't hold Left Shift, so B never registers: at every event pump
  SDL2 on Windows releases Left Shift if `GetKeyState(VK_LSHIFT)` says it is up, which is its fix for lost shift
  key-ups, and a posted message never sets that state. Such a test gives B a second key in the checkout's
  `controls.json` (`{"keyboard": {"B": [{"input_type": 1, "input_id": 225}, {"input_type": 1, "input_id": 27}]}}`
  keeps Left Shift and adds X; an input the file leaves out keeps its default) and presses that.
- **The game's own pacing**: 30 frames a second, two VIs a frame, triple-buffered. It yields its graphics task for
  audio (osSpTaskYield), which the runtime ignores.
- **Interpolation to the display's rate** (RT64's Framerate Display, the default) is `patches/interpolation.c`: every
  matrix the game draws is tagged with RT64's extended GBI so RT64 pairs each thing only with itself, and a camera cut,
  a new area or an object that jumps more than 500 units in a frame gets new ids, so it is drawn as it is rather than
  blended. Its header says what is tagged and why. Untagged, RT64 already blends most motion by guessing the pairs;
  what the tags fix shows at the edges. A driven play of the desktop build at 60 Hz (the castle grounds, the castle's
  front door, Bob-omb Battlefield's entry, a Goomba, a star spawned over Mario and its cutscene), captured from the
  game's window about 60 times a second, against the same build without the tags:
  - With the game at 30 and the screen at 60, each game frame's motion is two equal half steps, so every capture's
    change matches a neighbour's. Untagged, 12 of 38 moving captures by the Goomba matched neither, 28 of 303 in the
    star's cutscene and 10 of 338 in a full turn of the camera; tagged, none of them did.
  - Untagged, the castle door flashes open for one frame as Mario reaches for it, and the camera's settling behind
    Mario as he lands in Bob-omb Battlefield holds a frame and then jumps twice. Tagged, neither does.
  - Untagged, the dialogs' letters pair with any letter drawn with the same texture: in Lakitu's first dialog on the
    castle bridge, the letters of "reporting live from just" that repeat elsewhere drew blank or as another letter in 8
    to 17 of 24 captures, though every frame's list was the same. Tagged as one group in drawing order, none did, in
    24 captures of that line and 40 through its page turn.
  - The title's Mario head is goddard's own list, a matrix per part of the head and per sparkle of the star cursor.
    Paired in drawing order inside the generated node's group, its face was blended toward another part or a sparkle
    as the sparkles came and went: in about 6 of the first 16 captures of the title left alone at 4K, the skin, cap and
    hair were missing or squashed and the eyes, brows and mustache drew alone, and in 6 and 10 of 20 shots of the page
    in two plays in Chrome. Framerate Original drew it whole in all 16. As a group of its own that RT64 pairs by its
    guess (G_EX_ORDER_AUTO), it drew whole in all 21 captures, and in all 20 shots of the page in Chrome and in Firefox.
  - The skybox shows no uncovered edge through a full turn, and the door's star or circle wipe grows in half steps.
    Colour fades (the fade from white into a course) step at 30 as on a console: RT64 blends geometry, not colour.
- **Widescreen** (`patches/widescreen.c`, its header lists every place). RT64's Aspect Ratio Expand widens every
  full-screen projection by itself, hor+ about the middle, and stretches a fill or texture rectangle as wide as the
  scissor; the rest is the game's own code at the places the decomp's `GFX_DIMENSIONS` macros mark, reading the aspect
  ratio at run time (`recomp_get_aspect_ratio`, 4:3 under Original, so every patch falls through to the game's code).
  The HUD's rectangles are aligned to the window's edges with `gEXSetRectAlign`, and while they are the scissor is the
  window's (`gEXSetScissor` with LEFT and RIGHT origins, pushed and popped): the game's own 320-wide scissor is kept on
  the 4:3 middle, and a rectangle aligned past it draws clipped to it, a sliver or nothing. A label's origin defaults
  to NONE, not 0 (LEFT): text drawn at the window's edge on a screen that clears only its 4:3 (the title) stays there.
- **Model detail** (`patches/enhancements.c`). Mario's level-of-detail switch (600 and 1600 units) is only drawn while
  he moves (`geo_switch_mario_stand_run`): standing, he is always the full model, so a test of it runs him. At the
  camera's usual distance a running Mario is about 860 units away, the middle model on Original. A `GEO_RENDER_RANGE`
  switches only what is drawn: the object's animation advances in `geo_process_object` either way. That isn't so for
  culling and drawing distance: an object's animation advances only while it is drawn, which is why Draw Distance
  draws its far objects apart from the game's state (below), and why widescreen's wider culling (inherent to showing
  more) is under Aspect Ratio.
- **Draw Distance** (`patches/draw_distance.c`, its header says how). The game hides an object while Mario is further
  from it than its `oDrawingDistance` (4000 for most): at the end of `cur_obj_update`, or in
  `load_object_collision_model` for one with collision, as Bob-omb Battlefield's Chain Chomp gate. Hidden, it still
  runs its behaviour, but the game reads what it draws: its animation advances only in `geo_process_object`, behaviours
  wait on animations, a hidden object plays no sound (`spawn_sound.c`), and a few read `GRAPH_RENDER_ACTIVE` or
  `ACTIVE_FLAG_FAR_AWAY`. So the game keeps every flag as it decides it, and the renderer
  (`geo_process_node_and_siblings`) draws an object hidden only for its distance out to 4 times it, from a copy of the
  object's state that it puts back after: its animation's frame, `cameraToObject` (which places its sounds), the throw
  matrix, what its model's geo functions write, and the object it holds. The animation drawn advances in a copy of its
  own and goes back to the game's frame inside the game's distance. Objects in rooms and held objects are left as the
  game has them, and spawners that make objects only near Mario (coin formations, Goomba triplets) still do.
- **Input lag** (`patches/enhancements.c`). The game triple-buffers and swaps to the frame drawn the frame before
  (`sRenderedFramebuffer`); Reduced swaps to the one just sent. RT64 presents a swap after the task that draws it, so
  nothing tears.
- **Hi-res Font** (`src/game/hires_font.cpp`, its header says how), Original by default (the game's own pixel art) and
  On as the option, the one enhancement whose default is Original. On, the game makes its own texture pack from the ROM
  as it plays: each frame's list is walked, every texture drawn inside the game's text and HUD lists is hashed as RT64
  hashes it, and a new one is upscaled 4x with xBRZ into `hires_font/` in the app folder, a built-in pack
  (`runtime-patches/RecompFrontend-0001`). That folder is ROM-derived: never in git (`.gitignore`), CI or a page's
  `.data`. Its textures are made the first time each is drawn, so a test that wants the first-launch path turns it On
  and deletes the folder. While it is on, the text lists' render tiles are set to clamp in RDRAM: RT64 samples a
  replacement with a linear filter, and through the game's wrap a pixel-wide line of the letter's far edge showed down
  the side of a dialog letter. The clamp changes those shaders' sampler flags, so the page's shader list holds the
  text's shaders both ways (`src/rt64_shaders.txt`'s header). A pack made with another scaler or scale needs a new
  `pack_version`.
- **Rumble** (`patches/rumble.c`, its header says how): Shindou's rumble code over the US game. `patches/rumble/` holds
  each US function that Shindou rumbles in, 92 of them, copied from the decomp with its `#if ENABLE_RUMBLE` lines
  compiled in and nothing else changed but the narrow arguments (four of them). `rumble.h` turns ENABLE_RUMBLE on only
  after a file's headers, since it also gives `struct Controller` a field the US game doesn't have. The motor is the
  runtime's `osMotorStart` and `osMotorStop`, for which `main.cpp` reports a Rumble Pak in controller 1, and recompinput
  drives the gamepad at the General tab's Rumble Strength. A patch elsewhere of one of those 92 functions takes its
  rumble lines with it and leaves `patches/rumble/`.
