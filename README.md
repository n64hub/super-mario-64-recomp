# Super Mario 64: Recompiled

> **Made with AI.** Almost all of the code, documentation and tests in this repo were written by AI agents

A native PC port of the N64 *Super Mario 64* (USA), made by static recompilation
([N64Recomp](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp) + [N64ModernRuntime](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64ModernRuntime) +
[RT64](https://github.com/rt64/rt64), with [RecompFrontend](https://github.com/N64Recomp/RecompFrontend)'s launcher
and menus): the game's own MIPS code translated to C and run natively, with RT64 drawing it. The symbols come from the
[n64decomp/sm64](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64) decompilation. It is not an emulator.

The repo holds no ROM, no asset from the game and no data extracted from it: you supply your own ROM, and nothing in
git or CI is made from one except the symbol names and addresses in `syms/`.

**Status:** the desktop build plays: sound (the audio microcode recompiled), saves (EEPROM, kept across restarts) and
keyboard and gamepad input, drawn at the display's rate (the game runs at 30 and RT64 interpolates the frames between,
with nothing smeared at camera cuts, warps or spawns). Bob-omb Battlefield has been played from the file select
through King Bob-omb's star and back to the castle. It also builds into a web page (Chrome and Firefox, through WebGPU)
that plays the same.

**The web page plays at [n64hub.com/super-mario-64](https://n64hub.com/super-mario-64/)**,
from your own ROM through its Load ROM ([docs/web.md](docs/web.md)).

## Modern enhancements

Every one of these is an option on the settings menu's Graphics tab, and every option has an Original value that runs
the game as it shipped.

- **High resolution**: renders at the window's size, up to 4K and beyond, instead of 320×240, with 2× MSAA. The 3D,
  the fades and the wipes are sharp at any size.
- **Hi-res text**, off by default (Hi-res Font On turns it on): the HUD's numbers and icons, the power meter, and the
  letters of the dialogs, the pause screen, the act select and the file select are drawn smooth at any size instead of
  as the game's own pixel art, where at 4K each texel is a block of about 9×9 pixels. Nothing is shipped for it: the
  game upscales each of these textures four times from your ROM (with xBRZ, a pixel-art scaler) the first time it draws
  it, and keeps the result in a `hires_font` folder beside its settings, so a new letter shows as the original for one
  frame, once.
- **Smooth motion at the display's rate**: RT64 interpolates between the game's frames up to the monitor's refresh
  rate, 60 on a 60 Hz screen and more on a faster one, or at a rate set by hand. The game logic stays at 30, as on the
  console: Mario, the camera and every object move 30 times a second, and only what is drawn between is new.
- **Lower input lag**: the game shows each frame at the first screen refresh after it has drawn it, instead of a frame
  later, so what you press shows on screen one frame (33 ms) sooner.
- **Widescreen**: the view widens to the window's aspect ratio (the same height of the world, more of it at the
  sides), and the game keeps up at the sides: objects there are drawn instead of culled as off screen, the sky has
  enough columns, the HUD's lives, stars, timer and camera icon move out to the window's edges, the fades, the pause
  screen's shade and the cannon's black cover the whole window, the star and circle wipes start and end beyond its
  corners, and the title screen's tiled backdrop reaches its edges. The black lines the game keeps at the top and the
  bottom of the screen (8 of its 240, hidden on a television by its overscan) are gone, so the picture fills the
  window from top to bottom; Original keeps them. The dialogs, the menus and the coin counter stay
  centred, as the game centres them. The file select keeps its 4:3 box.
- **Model detail**: models keep their detailed versions four times as far out. Mario switches to a plainer model at
  600 and 1600 units while he moves, which at the camera's usual distance means the middle one: with this, it is the
  full one.
- **Draw distance**: objects are drawn four times as far from Mario as the game draws them. The game hides most
  objects more than 4000 units from Mario, so across a course they appeared only as he came near: the bars in front of
  the star behind Chain Chomp's gate show from Bob-omb Battlefield's start, 10,000 units away. Only what is drawn
  changes: out there an object moves and acts as the game has it, its sounds stay the game's, and its animation plays
  for the picture alone, so nothing an object does waits on being drawn. Objects the game makes only near Mario, such
  as a ring of coins or a group of Goombas, still appear where they did.
- **No frame copies to RAM**: each frame stays on the GPU instead of also being drawn again at 320×240 and copied back
  into the console's memory, which the game never reads.

Settings are saved as JSON in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SuperMario64Recompiled\` (`~/.config/SuperMario64Recompiled/` on
Linux), or in the working directory when it holds a `portable.txt`, so they can also be edited by hand while the game
is closed. For the game exactly as it shipped, set every Original value:

| Enhancement | Option | Key | Default | Original |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Smooth motion | Framerate | `graphics.json` `rr_option` | `"Display"` (the monitor's refresh rate; `"Manual"` sets one) | `"Original"` (30 fps) |
| Lower input lag | Input Lag | `graphics.json` `input_lag` | `"Reduced"` | `"Original"` |
| Widescreen | Aspect Ratio | `graphics.json` `ar_option` | `"Expand"` (the window's) | `"Original"` (4:3) |
| Widescreen HUD | HUD Placement | `graphics.json` `hr_option` | `"Clamp16x9"` (out to 16:9's edges; `"Expand"`: the window's) | `"Original"` (4:3's edges) |
| Rendering resolution | Resolution | `graphics.json` `res_option` | `"Auto"` (the window's size) | `"Original"` (320×240) |
| Hi-res text | Hi-res Font | `graphics.json` `hires_font` | `"Original"` (the game's pixel art; `"On"`: smooth) | `"Original"` |
| Anti-aliasing | MS Anti-Aliasing | `graphics.json` `msaa_option` | `"MSAA2X"` | `"None"` |
| Model detail | Level of Detail | `graphics.json` `level_of_detail` | `"High"` (4× the distances; `"Highest"`: always the most detailed) | `"Original"` |
| Draw distance | Draw Distance | `graphics.json` `draw_distance` | `"High"` (4× the distances) | `"Original"` |
| No frame copies to RAM | Copy Frames to RAM | `graphics.json` `copy_frames_to_ram` | `"Off"` (takes effect on the next start) | `"Original"` (every frame copied) |

Left out:

- **60 fps game logic**, because it would change how the game plays. The game's movement, physics, timers and
  animations are all counted in its 30 frames a second; running them at 60 is a port of every one of them, not an
  option.
- **Rumble.** The USA release has no Rumble Pak support (rumble came with the later Japanese *Shindou* edition), so
  the game never rumbles and the settings have no Rumble Strength.
- **Cheats.** None are built in; a code mod (Mods, below) can add them.

Not options, because they don't change the game: the keyboard and gamepad layouts (Controls), which are RecompFrontend's
defaults: WASD or the left stick for the stick, the arrows or the right stick for the C buttons.

## Mods

The Mods tab lists what is in the `mods` folder in the settings' folder (above), and turns each on or off. It takes
two kinds:

- **Texture packs** made for RT64 (`.rtz`, a zip holding an `rt64.json`): RT64 finds a texture by a hash of what the
  game loads, so a pack made with RT64's texture tools for this ROM works. Packs for other kinds of renderer do not
  load: the PC ports' (sm64ex, Render96, which replace the PNG files of their build by name) and GLideN64's or Rice's
  (`.hts`, `.htc`, folders of PNGs named by their hashes).
- **Code mods** (`.nrm`) built for this recomp with N64Recomp's mod tool against `syms/`, for the game ID `sm64`. A
  mod made for another recomp (Zelda64Recomp's, BanjoRecomp's) is another game's and doesn't load.

The web page takes no mods (docs/web.md).

## Getting it

Releases for Windows (a zip: unzip it and run `SuperMario64Recompiled.exe` from that folder) and Linux on x86-64 (a
`.tar.gz`: extract it and run `SuperMario64Recompiled` in that folder) are on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/n64hub/super-mario-64-recomp/releases), without the ROM: pick yours with Load ROM.
The Linux build needs glibc 2.35 or newer (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12 or later), a Vulkan driver, and GTK 3 and FreeType,
which desktop distributions have; it brings its own SDL2. Or build it as below.

## Building

You need Super Mario 64 (USA), SHA-1 `9bef1128717f958171a4afac3ed78ee2bb4e86ce`, as a big-endian `.z64`, at
`roms/sm64.us.z64`. On Windows: LLVM's clang-cl, CMake 3.31 and Ninja, and a clang with a MIPS backend plus ld.lld
for `patches/` (`tools/env.sh` sets the paths one machine uses; adjust it to yours). On Linux:
`clang lld libsdl2-dev libgtk-3-dev libfreetype-dev`, CMake 3.31 and Ninja.

From the repo's root in a bash shell:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
bash tools/recompile.sh -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl   # the game's code as C
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl \
      -DPATCHES_C_COMPILER=<MIPS clang> -DPATCHES_LD=<ld.lld>
ninja -C build SuperMario64Recompiled
```

`tools/recompile.sh` builds N64Recomp from the submodule the first time, then translates the game. Run
`build/SuperMario64Recompiled.exe` from the repo's root, pick the ROM with Load ROM, then Start Game.

The symbols in `syms/` are made from the decomp's own build of the game (`tools/build_decomp.sh`, which needs the ROM
and Docker, then `tools/gen_syms.sh`). They only change when `lib/sm64` moves.

A release is built by `tools/release.sh`: `windows` (Git Bash) and `linux` (Linux with Docker) build and pack its
two archives into `out/` from the same commit of `main`, and `publish` publishes them as the GitHub release
`v<version_string>` (`src/main/main.cpp`) with `releases/v<version>.md` as its notes (the script's header says more).

The web page is built on Linux with Docker by `tools/build_web.sh`, through
[N64Recomp-browser](https://github.com/n64hub/N64Recomp-browser) in `lib/N64Recomp-browser`:
[docs/web.md](docs/web.md) says how, and how to serve and play it.
